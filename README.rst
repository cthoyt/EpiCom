EpiCom - an Epilepsy comorbidity analysis using the overlapping genes in the literature
=======================================================================================

This repository contains code and resources used for the analysis described in Hoyt et al., 2018.

Structure of the project
------------------------

1. The resources and results folders contains all documents retrieved from SCAView queries as well as the tables and supplementary information presented in the paper

2. Notebooks: 

  - 'Epilepsy SCAIView comordbity analysis' outlines the calculations of pleitropy rates using the resources in the repository.
  - 'Epilepsy Knowledge Assembly Summary' contains the summary of the different subgraphs used to generate Table 2 of the manuscript.
  - 'Mechanism Enrichment Score Percentile Calculation' describes the statistical calculations for chosen a threshold based on  enrichment scores 

SCAIView queries
----------------

Following, the steps to follow in order to reproduce the data:

Click `here <https://github.com/cthoyt/EpiCom/blob/master/screenshots/step1.png>`_ to see how to make a query in `SCAIView <http://academia.scaiview.com/academia/>`_.
Next, `results of the query <https://github.com/cthoyt/EpiCom/blob/master/screenshots/step1.png>`_ will be displayed. Here, you can export the results by clicking in 'Export'.
Finally, to export the results to an excel file, click in `Export full table <https://github.com/cthoyt/EpiCom/blob/master/screenshots/step1.png>`_.
